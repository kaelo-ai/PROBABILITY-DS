# Mathematical Background
- **Uncertainty** is at the core of Data Science, the unprocessed, noisy data often with missing entries is what keeps Data Scientists in business. The objective is the unravel from the latent information embedded data. 
- **Data Science** is the subject of making decisions under uncertainty. 
- **Probability** is the mathematics of uncertainty uncertainty.
